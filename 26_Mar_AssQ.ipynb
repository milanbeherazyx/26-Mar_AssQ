Additionally, the intercept implies that everyone has a weight of 50 kg when their height is zero, which is obviously impossible, so the intercept should be interpreted with caution."

It is commonly used in machine learning algorithms, particularly in training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In simple terms, gradient descent starts with an initial guess for the optimal values of the parameters of a function, and then updates these values iteratively by computing the gradient of the function with respect to the parameters, multiplying the gradient by a small step size (known as the learning rate), and subtracting this value from the current parameter values. This process is repeated until the values of the parameters converge to a minimum of the function.\n",

    "\n",
    ">During the training process, the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases is computed, and the values of the weights and biases are updated using gradient descent. The learning rate determines the size of the step taken in each iteration, and it is important to choose an appropriate learning rate to ensure that the algorithm converges to a minimum without overshooting or oscillating.\n",

Another way to detect multicollinearity is to look at the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each independent variable.
